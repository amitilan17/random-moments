Random Moments / רגעי חולין

This is an Android app designed for observing and documenting everyday moments, with the aim of compiling them into a printed diary. It was developed as part of my final project in Visual Communication BDes at Bezalel Academy. Additional product and design specifications, intentions, and examples can be found here [link].

The primary goal during the app's development was to establish a working main flow and design, enabling potential users to experience the product. Therefore, the code emphasizes tailor-made, high-end UI & UX solutions, along with a working demonstration flow, rather than generalizing for different Android devices, languages, etc.

This app was showcased twice, and each occasion required different technological solutions to enhance the experience. As a result, two different servers were implemented:

Print Server - receives the data from the app, converts it to PDF, and prints it on a physically connected printer.
Email Server - receives the data from the app, stores it in Dropbox, and sends the manipulated output to the user with a delay. It's presumed to be running on a server that is always up.
